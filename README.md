# Replication-of-Kogan-s-Paper-for-Chinese-Companies-Patent-Value
This is a replication for part II of the main results in _Kogan, L., Papanikolaou, D., Seru, A. and Stoffman, N., 2017. Technological innovation, resource allocation, and growth. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 132(2), pp. 665-712_. The original replication code is available at `https://github.com/KPSS2017/Technological-Innovation-Resource-Allocation-and-Growth-Replication-Kit`. We reconstruct the calculation with `python`, and calculate the patent value issued by Chinese companies.
The files including:
1. The source data for stock code, stock price volatility and patent issuance named `cn_stock_patent.csv` is available at: `https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/6aa19100b7824a5baeca/`. The file exceeds the maximum upload size.
2. `patent_value_calculation.py` is the source code to calculate patent value from the volatility in stock price.
3. `patent_value_results.csv` contains the computation results of patent value issued by Chinese companies.
